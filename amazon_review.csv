R2CFE5CNT75T4H," Order them, you won't be sorry!",Special K,5,17-Apr-18,"I was very skeptical about ordering these lol I'm a side sleeper and have major pillow issues. For some reason, no matter the pillow, I wear them out within about 3 months typically. The ONLY pillows I have found so far are from Holiday Inn Express but they recently stopped selling them (still bummed). I read a LOT of reviews before ordering these. I need SOME firmness to mine so the pillow doesn't squish down to the bed when I lay my head on it and that is really difficult to gauge when ordering online. I bit the bullet and ordered these. These were vacuum packed and SO thin when they arrive that I doubted anything would puff them back up. Also, the outer shell material felt very cheap to me. I put them in the dryer one at a time and they came out HUGE. I slept like a baby the first night! Soft like a cloud but did not sink all the way to the bed with the weight of my head. Its now been 4 weeks and the last 2 days I woke up with a migraine, the first signs my pillows are too worn out for me. I stuck them in the dryer one at a time with 2 tennis balls and voila! Nice and puffy again. No migraine today. I HOPE that I can keep them alive by doing this, I would be ecstatic if I could get 6 months out of them.",positive
R32OAT2YT696AH, Beyond Impressed. I Put These Pillows Through Hell.,DavesNotHere,5,21-Dec-17,"As far as pillows go these would be 4 or 5 stars. I have had 2 of these for almost 3.5 months. I am a strapping 6' 0"" tall 300 pound manly man who sleeps with my pillows wrapped up like they're in a choke hold. I also drive my elbows into them throughout the night as well. They have held up surprisingly well. I am beyond impressed.",positive

R26PM7HDCQ7UMN, Don't buy,M workman,1,23-Sep-18,"I wouldn't know never received all of them. The others seem ok, when I called amazon to tell what happened, the call was escalated to a supervisor, that was the worst experience I have had. I was shamed for ordering 92 times on prime membership account, he was very arrogant, in all the most horrible customer service supervisor ever! So no I advised not to buy, unless you want to be shamed for ordering this product!!",negative
R7QGLJKP9VI73, Wonderfully comfortable,Kindle Customer,5,5-Feb-18,"My husband & I are both side sleepers who have disk & nerve issues with our necks and backs. I hadn't bought us new pillows for way too long and the ones we had were old, flat & lumpy. So when I saw these on a Lightning Deal, I figured that the price definitely made these worth a shot (although they're not exactly expensive normally). I got us a queen size set in blue & prepped them in the dryer as suggested. They didn't have any weird smell like some other customers had mentioned, but I put a few drops of lavender essential oil on them anyway because I love the smell & it's so soothing. The 1st night we slept on the new pillows was amazing. I have compressed disks & pinched nerves in my neck, and I usually wake up with a lot of pain there, but not since I bought these. They are exactly the right balance of firm & soft for a side sleeper who likes to read her Kindle in bed. Since I got these about a week ago, both my husband and I have woken up feeling more rested & in less pain than we have in months. Even our cat loves them! When she's in our bedroom with us, she'll lay down in the middle of one of our pillows if it's empty. If we're both laying down she'll curl up over our heads on the place where the two pillows meet. These pillows are definitely worth 5 stars and 5 meows!",positive
R3H5V9U8090ZFP, Spare bedroom pillows,Amber Gilchrist,5,23-Jul-17,"These pillows are down alternative. They are a softer pillow. If you like a firm pillow these would not be the best choice.
The packaging was well done. Air tight. (No chance for critters from warehouse storage) The instructions for fluffing the pillows was convenient. A few shakes and pulls and they were good to go!",positive
R1G76YBLF2RLS9, Great pillow for side sleepers,A. Pelletier,5,21-Sep-17,"I have had these pillows a few weeks now, and as a side sleeper I love them. The pillows 'fluff up"" and are firm enough that I only really have to use one of them. I have been using 2 pillows for years in order to support my head comfortably. You will however need to use queen or king sized pillow cases, these are big pillows and regular pillow cases will ride up on them over the course of a night.

As in all things, there is only rarely a one size fits all solution. These pillows may not be right for you, but after unpacking them and letting them fluff up to their full size (they were compressed down to fit in the shipping box) I have been extremely happy with these pillows. They are firm so if you want a soft pillow they will not work for you and they have a lot of loft. However if you, like me, are a side sleeper they could well be the solution to your sleeping problems.",positive
R3RFYQOBSYFJTT, I like different types of pillows depending on how I’m feeling,Christy Tanner,5,10-Apr-18,"I like different types of pillows depending on how I’m feeling. I had been down to one pillow for the past two years as a stomach sleeper but I’m currently pregnant and need more than that now. These pillows are packaged flat with all the air sucked out and then you fluff them when they arrive. I hand fluffed and then tossed them in the dryer for a few minutes and these puffed up to be quite large and supportive. I’m using one under my head stacked on top of my other pillow and one between my knees to support my hips. (Pregnancy really is painful - why do we women do this to ourselves? Oh yeah, cute babies... anyway...) These pillows will also come in handy when the baby gets here because I’m going to need the extra support propped up in bed while nursing.

I actually bought the first round of these pillows for my husband because he is a pillow stealer. I was down to my one pillow and was worried he was going to take that one too. When these arrived I was impressed with how supportive they were and that’s how I knew they would be great for getting me through this third trimester.

Side note, because they fluff up so well, if you’re just looking for an inexpensive pillow for your nice pillow shams, these would do a great job of filling them out well and looking nice on your bed. Also, the packaging says if they start to lose their shape to just throw them back in the dryer and they’ll fluff right up. We’ve had my husband’s set for 3 months now and they’re holding steady and haven’t needed refluffing yet.",positive
R1WDWYXO3OCHVV, No head support-very soft,Amazon Customer,2,11-Jul-19,"Pillows come vacuum sealed which is fine for shipping. Just a heads up though. They are incredibly thin and do not give much support at all. If you like super soft pillows, these are good but I like firm pillows that actually support my neck and head and these do not. I will be using them for decorative shams and buying more comfortable pillows.",negative
R1DTCG51V6T6O1, Save your time and money...,Lucy S,1,27-May-19,"These pillows looked like a dream, but after using them for one night - they were a nightmare.
First, one of the pillows arrived with stuffing falling out of it (see photos). But I thought it would be just a small issue...until I used them (after deflating them properly) and my neck was SORE the next day.
These pillows do NOT provide good support, they are made with very cheap material, and I can't recommend them to anyone!
In the garbage they go...",negative
R2MJGJWKOWTAP5, Wicked comfy,Chessie,5,13-Jul-19,"Super comfortable for back and side/belly sleepers. My husband sleeps like a rockstar that is just this side of an OD. As soon as his head hits this pillow he's down for the count and I don't even need headphones for my YouTube rabbit holes I go down because my brain doesn't always say sleep is cool.
Once I do sleep, I'm a flipper. Dozens of times a night, and this pillow accommodates all positions.",positive
R2VYF9GK4DFNCC, pleasent dreams after all,Phil,4,2-May-17,"Great pillow. Bought this at a great price thinking if I didn't like it I'd use them in the guest room. Surprise, the pillows are very comfortable. The gusseted edge adds support that I haven't had with other pillows. After about a week the change from our old pillows is strikingly positive. Great price, good constuction, pleased so far. Would buy again.",positive
R3EELHXM1YMPK2, Two Per Package; Shrinkwrapped,Ms. Martin,3,19-Nov-18,"First, these come in a two pack. So ordering one gets you two pillows. Maybe I overlooked that in the description but I ended up with four pillows. Not a big issue, since switching pillows is my thing.
Second, they come shrink wrapped into the smallest package imaginable. About the size of a set of sheets. Then they come out flat and you need to “leave them in the sun for 48 hours. What? My son and his wife won’t be here for 48 hours so we’ll see if the pancake pillows fluff up and stay fluffy!",neutral
R25E7C3UPVE3RJ, Hot Pillow,Emily,3,5-Aug-19,"Pillow buying online is difficult because you are choosing a pillow based on product descriptions and customer reviews. I prefer a Firm, Supportive, Stay Cool pillow. These pillows were delivered in great packaging. Are firm but soft and give you great support BUT they do not stay cool. They get so hot it is not comfortable to sleep on them. They are now in the decorative pillow shams that no one uses.",neutral
RLX51X5KIFJ2, WORST PILLOWS DO NOT BUY,Vernell Taylor,1,14-Jul-20,"This by far is the worst pillow that I've ever slept on I've took several pictures you sleep on it one night and the next night all of the inside of the pillow is pushed to one side and you can't straighten it out it's the worst quality the worst product please do not buy this pillow I've taken enough pictures to show you the poor quality and the poor make of this pillow I don't know who wrote those reviews prior cuz I read the reviews and they said that they were good but some of them said that they were good not all but the ones that I did read I should have kept reading
I've also taken pictures of it in the pillow case and the pillow looks all twisted up and looks deformed
I'm so disappointed in this pillow
I just hope that this will help someone else reading these reviews DO NOT BUY this pillow this company ought to be ashamed of yourself for selling pillows that look like it could have been sold at the thrift store this is ridiculous

Within one week of using this my sleep had completely changed. No more tweaked neck, or headaches at all. I sleep much better. Am still amazed after 1 month of how much it changed my sleep for the better. Highly recommended.",positive
R3HCYV9MD57V20, What a goose-down pillows!,Eliiii,1,12-Jan-20,"Despite the description on the product page, I somehow purchased goose down pillows. A foam- or cotton-filled pillows are what was on my radar to buy. It must’ve been a total impulse buy. I received them and I didn’t even open the package when I noticed bird feathers sticking out of the pillowcase. Have any of you slept with a goose-down pillow? I’ve had personal experience with them before this Amazon purchase. They’re comfortable,ehh. Until one of the feather shafts sticking out of the pillow pokes you in the face or any other body part! It’s a bit like a mini-torture game....that I’d prefer not to repeat, ever! The company did give me a refund, no questIons asked. Thanks.",negative

R278P56PO50HDT, Soft with a firm center,Applewhite Minyard,5,24-Jan-18,"Very good. I was hesitant to purchase pillows online without having felt them, but even when buying in person it is difficult to judge how a pillow will feel under your head on the bed at night. My previous pillows were satisfactory, but too small for my queen sized bed. These are the right size to fill the space and the pillowcases, and the quality seemed good in the description. The reality is that they are much better than I imagined. They are somewhat ""puffy,"" but they are also soft and resilient, so that when you lay your head on them, they collapse down, but not too much. They offer support and softness simultaneously, making them, in my opinion, the ideal bed pillow.",positive
R2KRT1KRT0U8KZ, They are fine. They are pillows.,Bean,5,18-Dec-21,"Nothing special, but in a good way. These pillows are a cheap way to make houseguests feel welcome for 24 hours. These aren't garbage pillows that will make your guests resent you, and they aren't so comfortable that anyone will steal them or start an awkward conversation about where you got them. These are the beige Ford Taurus of pillows.

R6DOVEG8Q3MD8, Very Comfortable and Great Fluff to it,Monica Hough,5,18-Jun-17,"I ordered two of the queen and two of the standard. They were sealed well air tight and as soon as I opened them up they fluffed right up. Later that evening I put cases on and used them to sleep. My husband said he loved these. I really like how your head doesn't sink into it, leaving it flat below your head like some pillows. While I really love a down pillow, these keep their fluff and provide more support. Very comfortable and looks good on the bed. Not warped looking.",positive
R5BYBI6173VUX, Great Pillows!,Sam,5,26-Aug-19,"After using a few months I am happy to report that these are great sleeping pillows. Am sidesleeper and like how they are not too firm and nestle my head. They do not go flat either, as I had read in some reviews. Great price for two super pillows.",positive
RJXQSTAUQ5AX2, Buyer Beware! (Read my comments!),Amazon Customer,1,14-Feb-21,"1. These pillows do not look nearly as fluffy as in the picture (not as advertised)
2. They sink and go flat offering no support (ouch neck pain)
3. Looking at older reviews it seems the pillows have changed, look for more recent reviews for an accurate description of these ‘new’ pillows
4. They look nice in the pillow shams but if you try to actually sleep on it as a side sleeper you will wake up with upper back/neck pain
Buyer beware!",negative
RJI8S61OUFJ6J, Piece of crap,me,1,13-Nov-17,"I bought because they had a high rating. I guess the users giving these pillows a high rating were high. Flimsy, thin, worst pillows I've bought on Amazon. I've bought pillows at dollar stores of the same quality and I've seen pet beds made better than this. I can only say they're clean and new, and possibly the pets will take residence on them.",negative
R10YS69WIOX6FO, Not bad but I've had better. ...that's what she said!,Anna,3,1-Jun-20,"I've had these pillows for a year and a half now. They haven't been bad pillows for the first year. The first week was tough because they were *too* fluffy. They finally settled down. After about 6 months my husband was finally happy with his. However the stitching came undone in his and there was pillow stuffing everywhere, so it became customizable for him until I stitched it closed.
My pillow, after about 15 months became extremely lumpy, seemingly overnight. I had to wash it due to pink eye and the dryer couldn't even refluff it. It feels like a bag of giant pom pom balls. The stuffing shifts sound like crazy too. One side of the pillow is flat, the other side too thick. I've tried everything I could think of.
Now I don't really know the life span of a pillow but I do know I've had the cheap Serta cooling pillows from Walmart last much longer, even with washing and drying multiple times.",neutral
R36CKR0YOYUK0A, If you thought pillows were insignificant..,H. Fouts,5,30-Mar-20,"These are the most luxurious pillows I have ever touched...better than any hotel I have stayed in. When I opened the rather small box these arrived in, I was a bit disappointed thinking how unsatisfying these would probably be. They are packed two in a box but wrapped separately folded in half. So they are smooshed down pretty well and it seems impossible they will grow to be ""real"" pillows. The instructions show various ways to ""fluff"" them up: either in the sun, by hand, etc. In the amount of time it took me to read the instructions after I opened the pillows, they were already fluffing up a bit on their own. So I put the pillow cases on them and laid them on the bed. 10 minutes later I came back and they seemed to be fully ""fluffed"" and beautiful. More than I imagined or anticipated.
They are very ""cool"" in that no matter where you lay your head they are very cool to the touch and very supportive and almost ""firm"" but not too much. I can fold them around and puff them up in various ways and they respond nicely. Inside the pillow case on my bed they just seem huge because there is so much of them. So fluffy. But when you lay down on it, it responds entirely to the weight and pressure of whatever body part is on them and they are SO comfortable. Full but soft. Firm but relaxed. And then POOF they fluff back up to such a full pretty size. It makes me want to jump back into bed just to lay on the pillows.
I bought two Queen size and two King size and used them a lot over the weekend watching movies, reading a book, napping, etc. and right now they look like no one has touched them since I opened the package. So pleased.
I never thought pillows were so significant...just no big deal...but I was wrong.",positive
R2BI48I5PM3K8M," If a cloud was a bodybuilder, it would be this pillow",Rod Rhaspy,5,26-Aug-20,"This pillow causes slight coma

RDM9QURL3C4A9, This was probably the best purchase of my entire life,Chris,5,4-Oct-19,These were the first brand new pillows I ever had (growing up I just got hand me downs). .

R3CUGX09V2RMSJ," Perfect for back, side or stomach sleepers. Nice quality!",Anony,5,25-Jun-18,"Initially I purchased these pillows to go in my dogs crate. He’s small and dainty and these seemed like they’d be the perfect size for him. I was all set to put his doggie pillowcase on one of them and that’s when I realized the dog was getting a pillow off my bed and I was taking these new pillows for myself! They are really nice for the price!! I’m all over the place when I sleep; side, back, stomach . . . and in all of those positions these pillows are super comfy. They are supportive, fluffy without being smushy, firm without being too stiff. Here’s the lowdown in pillowcases. They fit in standard pillowcases that come with twin sheet sets and they also work nicely with queen pillowcases. My King size pillowcases are too long but I tucked the extra length down inside the pillowcase and the width was perfect. I came back to order a second pair for our guest room! I washed and dried them after I was sick (to kill the cooties) and they laundered beautifully. Nothing but positive experiences with these pillows. Maybe one day my dog will get one of these pillows for himself but for now he’s sleeping on a queen size My Pillow so don’t feel sorry for him. Yes, I gave up a My Pillow for these. They’re a lot more comfortable!",positive
RU23CBK8B3Z2J, Good but not perfect.,Jonny J.,4,19-Dec-20,Good pillows for the price. I am very picky when it comes to anything I buy and demand value for my dollar. These are not perfect by any means but $27 for two king size pillows...not bad. They form nice to my body as I'm mostly a side sleeper. I bit puffier in initial form than I prefer but they collapse nicely and do not have an instant springback which can be annoying. They are extremely big and barely fit into the pillow cases. They are a decent down alternative and have good support..maybe just a tad too much for my liking but again I'm picky. I've read other reviews before purchasing these and I can see what others mean about the stitching. It looks flawed in many spots and I could see where quality control could be an issue however I've had no issues with my set. If your expecting luxury for $27 look elsewhere...but for the money you'll have a tough time finding better.,positive
R3RJ1LQB8229CT, Somewhat disappointed side sleeper,Amazon Customer,4,17-Aug-20,I’m a side sleeper who prefers two pillows but they always end up flat and uncomfortable. Last summer I bought a memory foam pillow which was super soft yet firm but not quit the right height so I gave it to my bf. Based off other reviews this seemed like a similar pillow but just right for side sleepers. Unfortunately while this pillow is soft yet somewhat firm reminding me of a down pillow it is not quite what I was looking for. One pillow was definitely not enough support for sleeping on my side so I decided to go with two which had me awake after a few hours with neck pain. I tossed and turned most of the night trying to figure out exactly how to get the pillows just right. Finally I decided one using an old flat pillow and one of these pillows to meet my Goldilocks standards. I just wish it was easier to find the right pillow,positive
R2NHKKX1Z2TD5J, Loud filling,Nth,3,31-Jan-21,"I had bought these pillows previously and they were good. I decided when opening up one of my spare rooms as a guest room that I wanted to order some more. The product has changed and this new model contains some of the loudest polyfill down alternative I've ever experienced in my life. You can literally hear it expand and collapse. You can hear it slowly crunching beneath the weight of your head.
It's still fluffy yet firm enough to support the space between your legs when laying on your side. From there you can barely hear the material inside.",neutral
R4691FBZAGPG1, Not happy at all.,Kristen M.,1,5-Mar-20,I ordered a queen size pillow it’s marked as a queen size pillow but I got a standard size pillow.

RRJDIF7ZT0MAZ, VERY NICE PILLOWS,SPARROW,5,21-Jan-21,"I am very happy with my purchase. I received the pillows in perfect condition and they were very well packaged. I was pleasantly surprised that they are very decent pillows for such a low price. They are not premium pillows, but who would expect premium at this price. The pillows are not firm, but I found them sufficiently supportive and do not bottom out. After allowing them to expand for a couple of hours, I put them in the dryer for 5 or so minutes and they completely puffed-up. I slept on them for one night so far and they are comfortable and exceeded my expectations. I understand from the reviews, when they eventually flatten, which i expect they will, just put them in the dryer with or without tennis balls and they will puff-up again. You will only be disappointed if you are expecting a very supportive, firm, substantial premium pillow. For that , you will need to pay a premium price.",positive
RL5MPA5I5WW38, Not as described by manufacturer. Looks are deceiving!,HappyMom,2,26-Aug-21,"Make sure to look at the pictures from reviewers to make sure you know what you are getting. And second, do not believe anyone who says that these pillows are supportive and somewhat firm. They come sealed and pressed to about a 1-inch flat thickness. You then have to ""fluff"" them back up yourself. The pillow does fluff up (and looks nice), but looks are deceiving! Once you put any weight or pressure on the pillow it sinks back down to nothing. It is like sleeping on a very few and very old down feathers that have lost their ""mojo."" I ended up using them in shams mostly for decoration on a daybed (and why I gave them a 2 rating) and would never expect anyone to use them for sleeping (perhaps piled on top of one another so they would then get 2 inches of pillow depth).
UPDATE: Whatever the filling is keeps ""seeping"" out of the pillows, even though they are not really being used, and it seems to get everywhere. We ended up bagging the pillows and are now wondering if we should just toss. Hubby did manage to get them flattened some to fit into the zippered plastic storage thing. Maybe will give these to someone who has a dog or cat. But then, who would want to have to clean up even more ""fluff"" in their home?",negative
R3HRIOS18TUK5N, Great for Side Sleepers!,April K,5,12-Jul-19,"I was surprised it had arrived in such a small pack. After opening and letting the pillows fill out, They were easily fluffed and perfect for side lying sleeping. Loving them so far, going to order a second set",positive
R64642MQR72U8, Used to love!,Kimberly Brannon,3,31-Jan-21,"Which pillow is the new one? The left.

I have been owning this brand of pillows for at least 3-4 years. I have sold my friends and family for no less than 15-20 orders.

My personal pillows just wore out. I am totally happy for what I got for what I paid. You just need new pillows every few years.

Broke down and got a new pair. So excited for them to come in. I actually found clean tennis balls to fluff them in my dryer.

After almost 72 hours, my husband’s new pillow looks sad against my old pillow. I will say that I have slept on my new one now two nights. I’m not unhappy, but this is a much more flat pillow. If you like a thin firm pillow you may like.

So while I don’t hate. They just are not the same pillow I bought at least personally 5 times. Wish they were like the original!",neutral
R1TJ3QGX95KOJ3," Surprisingly comfortable, exactly what I wanted",Trevor,5,25-Apr-20,"I have been the type of person that has been trying to find the right pillow for my needs for years. I've found that each pillow was too hard, too small, too short, gave me neck pains, etc. I was very surprised to find that these pillows work wonderfully for me, and have been the most comfortable pillows I have ever used. I have tried memory foam, both solid and shredded, bamboo, cotton, feather, and many variations of each, but I am extremely satisfied with these pillows. They're comfortable, fluffy without being too tall, and hold their shape without being too tough.

The info for these pillows says ""hypoallergenic"", which basically means that they are plastic or nylon outsides, which I found a bit deceptive based on the pictures and description but is nonetheless accurate. They appeared to be cloth outsides like similar ones I've seen, but are basically plastic covers. They come shrink wrapped and then tied with a ribbon which may create somewhat of a crease down the middle, but it seems to almost completely go away by the time you are ready to use it. It took a few hours to fluff up completely, but they do fluff up nicely, enough to sink into but still support the weight of your head. I do recommend these pillows.",positive
RS0WN0FZ2QO43, Sleep like a dream!,LauraKat,5,22-Feb-20,"I ordered these on a whim and am very pleased. I am a side sleeper who has had frequent neck kinks causing me not to be able to turn my head fully from one side to the other without sharp pain. After sleeping on these pillows for about a month my neck issues have greatly reduced. I do tend to root into my pillows so I flip them regularly and toss them into the dryer when they start going flat. I figured since that was how the manufacturer recommended to get them up to their full size after unpacking them, it would work and it does! They didn't have any noticable odor when I opened them and I have a sensitive sniffer. I will definitely order these again should the need arise.",positive
R1WGIMD3VT8KZC, Superior pillow,WJ,5,21-Jun-21,"These pillows are *chef's kiss*. My partner and I actually stayed at a hotel that had these pillows and were so surprised at how comfy they were, that I immediately looked them up once we got back home.

These are the real deal and super affordable. We'd both been looking for pillow replacements for a long time, but it was hard to narrow down (esp if you're buying online).

Honestly, I'd be surprised if this pillow DIDN'T work for most people. It's so comfy - we've both slept considerably and noticeably better on these pillows. I toss around at night and like to do a back-side-stomach routine, and this pillow is comfy regardless of postion.

Honestly if you're thinking about trying this pillow out, I'd say just do it. Chances are you'll love it, and if not, it's Amazon and returns are easy.",positive
RFMAPDIT5KTE9, This pillow lets me sleep again,M. Downes,5,20-Feb-21,"I lost my perfect pillow in a house fire four years ago. It wasn’t a special pillow. It was just old and comfy and perfectly suited to letting me enjoy a good night’s sleep. You don’t realize how precious that is until you’re waking up every morning feeling like the aliens had you drinking whiskey shots while running on a treadmill all night again.

I can’t say how many pillows I’ve been through in hopes of rediscovering that perfect comfort. It’s so individual. I tried down pillows, gel pillows, contoured pillows...a constellation of pillows. What have I learned?

Price doesn’t guarantee a better pillow. Neither do gimmicks.

I didn’t have high hopes for this pillow. Its price point doesn’t scream “Sleep like a baby!” Some of the bad reviews were a little scary. But I took a gamble, and dang if I didn’t finally luck out.

You get two pillows, and both arrive vacuum packed so let them fluff up for several hours before using them. They aren’t FIRM. if you’re looking for solid support from a pillow, move on. This is more like sinking your head into a pile of the softest cotton balls. It gives, but never feels like a rock. It isn’t at all lumpy. I’ve never felt the mattress through it.

Since using this pillow I’ve slept straight through the night and wake up feeling rested. So either the aliens have moved on to torture someone else...or I've finally found my pillow.

Now, I can’t tell you what to do. I’m not your mother. But I hope my experience helps someone else find their perfect night’s sleep.",positive
R2MD3F17ETLMSD, Slightly different than expected but still pretty nice overall,JustSomeRandomGuy,4,6-Nov-18,"The price point on these seems just a little high, but I'm not exactly disappointed with the purchase. I was expecting just a little more firmness and thickness to the pillows, but they are still rather comfortable, just not quite as much as I had hoped. It's definitely an upgrade from the worn out pillows I was using before, yet don't expect a lot of ""cushion"". They are probably about 2 to 4 inches more ""flat"" than I thought they would be, but they aren't ""bunchy"" like a feather pillow that can get ""saggy spots"", they have a ""nice and even texture"" which I like. The packaging suggests to leave them in direct sunlight for an extended period of time after unwrapping them from the vaccuum sealed bags they come in, which I did not do, but after using them for a few weeks I am glad I replaced what I was using before. Not too shabby.",positive
RNGIEV5XOFVQX," Updated review, 18 months later…. Don't get the complaints, really pleased with these pillows!!!",Working Mom,5,15-Oct-20,"18 month update: these pillows are incredible!!! We have been using them daily since Jan 2020 and they’re nearly as fluffy as the first day. The pic I included is from today, Aug 2021. These pillows are worth ordering!!!!

Original review: It seems like no matter how much I spend on pillows, they're flattened like pancakes after a couple months. These pillows have held up AWESOME for us. We use them every single night to sleep and still have all the thickness from day one. They are soft....because they're pillows....but they offer some substance, in my opinion. Would recommend and will buy again!",positive
R1FAG5ZH1VY17F, Really Disappointing,Jaqi,1,20-Apr-21,"EDIT: Note the bad reviews on these are mostly for the Kings, which again, as in my review below, seem to have a lot less filling than they should. It's like buying a mostly-empty can (containing very little product).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am truly disappointed in these. I was not expecting them to be as tall or as perfectly pictured as in the images displayed when purchasing them, but I figured they would still be quite a deal, especially in comparison to the prices of other 'trending' King-sized pillows on the market, which I find ridiculous. I waited for them with baited breath and upon receipt, glady fluffed them up as per the directions (both, the shaking method, and when that did not expand them enough, the dryer method). They remained pretty thin and again, nothing like pictured. Having been compressed and folded for shipment and prior to the fluffing-up attempts, they also had a fold crease toward the middle which did not seem to want to hold stuffing. Sleeping on them, is meh.

The problem, as I see it, is that the stuffing is either way too soft, or that they use the amount of stuffing-material needed for Standard-sized pillows in the Kings we ordered - and there is simply just NOT ENOUGH to go around inside the pillow. It feels 1/3 empty, if that makes any sense.

I happened to have ordered two sets (four pillows) and if we were to open the second set, I suppose we could each sleep on two each, but it just irks me a little that we'd need to do that instead of just having bought a pillow which looks and feels and performs as advertised.",negative

The noise these things make is ridiculous. Going pillow shopping tomorrow. ****update: these pillows are loud.

Something I never thought I’d say about a pillow and it’s definetly enough to make me come back and update this review.*** Upon opening the box I was very surprised that these were the two pillows I ordered. The first photo is how they were folded in the package, about 5” thick. The second photo is unfolded to show how thin these are vacuum sealed. I thought for sure these were going to be a disappointment. Third photo shows one pillow less than 3 minutes after opening. The second to last last photo is one pillow stacked on top of the other after 5 minutes. I’m really impressed. They are not flimsy at all and seem like they will offer the perfect amount of support. No odd smells and they fluffed right up. I haven’t even put them in the dryer to do additional fluffing as I don’t think it will be necessary. Last photo is 10 minutes later!",negative

Rather than sending it right back, i used some fabric glue to repair the seam. However, because pillow contents was overflowing out of seam, I took a moment to lightly push the pillow stuffing down below the seam, so it could be resealed. OUCH!!! Something very sharp resides within the insides. I still don't know what it was but as I pushed down the innards, I was jabbed in the top of my finger right under the nail and out came the blood. I have not examined the stuffing to know what it was. But clearly, it's something that should not be in there and I'd say it's neither a nail or a piece of glass. Very sharp. Jabbed without me using any force in pushing down the stuffing.

I could get the same uncomfortable, cheap pillow from a dollar store. There is absolutely no support at all. When you put your head on one of the pillows, it will sink to your mattress with the sides of the pillow filling with the pillow’s interior material(s).

R6A5XD25VOY8Y, Review after 2 Months,Pastor Richard,4,28-Sep-21,"I purposely waited 2 months before writing a review of the Utopia bed pillows. The same pillow can elicit different opinions from everyone who tries it. This review will be no different.

The two pillows I received in late July 2021 were in excellent condition and firm to the head. Some reviews said they'd had no problems with the pillows going flat, and if they ""plumped"" them they regained their firmness. This is not my experience. I still use and like the pillows, but they are flat even after attempts to plump them each night.

Positive: The quality and workmanship is excellent as far as I'm concerned. Both pillows remain comfortable and the stuffing hasn't clumped at one end of the pillow.

Negative: My only complaint is the lack of keeping their firmness and shape.

Would I buy this product again? Probably not, but they continue to do the job.",positive
R20U4UNB4F9413, More of a pressure relief than support pillow,CountryLane,3,12-Dec-20,"Look, I'll make no bones about the fact that this is a very comfortable pillow. As other reviewers note, you need to give it a few hours to decompress, then run it through the ""Freshen Up"" or equivalent setting on the dryer to fully fluff it up. At that point, it's like dropping your head onto a cotton puff.

At initial contact, your head sinks in softly and eventually finds and equilibrium with the internal loft of the pillow. While I'd highly recommend this pillow for people with TMJ and other conditions that make normal pillow pressure on the face uncomfortable, it compresses a bit too much to be a good pillow for those who need more substantial neck support. It fluffs back up easily in the morning with a quick shake, but that's not a benefit if you didn't sleep well from inadequate neck support. Also, note that this pillow is slightly smaller than other 20x30 queen pillows. That's great if you use a traditional open-ended pillowcase since the larger pillows protrude slightly (they're better-suited for envelope style pillowcases.)",neutral

When the pillows first arrived, I couldn't believe how flat they were because they were vacuumed sealed. After opening them from the bag, you're instructed to keep shaking each one until it slowly inflates to the proper size, which can take up to 24 hrs. In comparison to other pillows I've bought, I can say that this is slightly better than the ones with the sheep, those from a club, those big or mighty ones, or bamboo like.

It’s just so nice to sleep on these. The queen size pillows fit your standard size pillowcases in case that is helpful.
The packaging was pretty cool. The 2 pillows were each in there own air sealed bags folded nicely together in another bag. You just had to clip the bags and take them out to fluff them a little bit. They had a good “new purchase” smell which was nice (not sure this is needed to be known).

Well, I was correct. They were poorly made and the loose stuffing I saw on the inside of the plastic was because the seams were busted and stuffing was just coming out.

They puffed up into these big fluffy pillows. They are nearly body pillow sized, and stuffing them into pillowcases was a bit of an adventure. They do fit, but only if you use the pocket type pillowcase not the standard sleeve type pillowcase. I should have read the dimensions a bit more carefully, that's my error. The manufacturer / seller is entirely not at fault for my lack of reading comprehension.

Sleeping on them is great, the husband can sleep slightly propped up, and I can wrap around mine like some sort of sleeping octopus. So far we are loving them. Great value for the price.

I bought them based on a recommend from Matt Granite, and they were on sale. I'm a side sleeper, so I thought these would work well. However, there are two problems with this pillow.

The lesser of the two problems is comfort. They are not the most comfortable pillow, especially the first few days I had them, however, that's probably more of a personal preference. I like fluffy, soft pillows. These are neither of those.

The second and biggest problem, is the pillows do not hold their shape. I sometimes like to fold my pillow in half and lay on it, or bunch it up to get more fluff or support. I've always done this, but never had a pillow lose its shape so fast. As you can see from the pictures, one pillow I use, one is a spare. Whenever I try to flatten the pillow back out, it's lumpy and just goes right back to having the weird shape.

After a couple days I put an old firm pillow in-between the 2 new pillows to try to get some support. Didn't work. Put the firm one on top and that seemed a little better..at least my face didn't get covered by the new pillow. I gave these a chance for a month, waking up with a neck ache every day. 2 days after switching back to only using my two old pillows my neck stopped hurting. After seeing recent reviews I'm wondering if something changed because it used to get rave reviews and comments about how these are soft but don't sink in too much. Mine would sink in to nearly flat.

As far comfort ... it's way too plush for a side sleeper or any type of sleeper. I sometimes roll onto my back at the end of my sleep cycle. This holds my head so high that I wake up with a neck ache. So I bought another pillow at a big chain place and use this to hug at night.",negative

All four remain in constant use with no degradation. We all try to find the perfect pillow and I've had my share. This has by far been the best pillow I have owned. I believe it is due wholly to the gusseted design, allowing the pillow to expand more fully without the drop-off on the edges found on most pillows. The fill is durable and comfortable, does not clump, and does not flatten or become hollowed out where you lay. The cover itself is extremely soft and does not pile or pique. It remains comfortable and soft throughout the night with just enough firmness to support the neck and head appropriately. After each washing the pillows remain plump and reliably shaped as it was when new. I recommend these for any style of sleeper because I am every style of sleeper. I can find no fault with this product, and that is a rare position.",positive
R1EE7A1A03OKBK, Obsessed with these pillows,GingaNinja,5,17-Dec-19,"I bought two of these pillows a few months ago and I love them. Based on the other reviews they seemed like a good pillow for back and side sleepers. Having used them for awhile I can confirm they deliver.

I sleep with only 1 pillow so my spine is fairly straight and not bent at an angle. The 1 pillow is super supportive and more than enough.

Pillows have enough fluff/softness so your heads sinks into the pillow a little/doesn't feel like a brick but is firm enough to give good support.

The pillows are not as fluffy when I first got them but that is to be expected since I have had them for a few months now. Even with this, they are great pillows and still supportive. I will definitely be buying more.",positive
R2THVBMJ799WUS, Waaay too soft,Ben,3,14-Oct-21,"I opened the nicely packaged pillows. Fluffed them, ran them in the dryer and laid them on my bed. The big melon attached to my neck hit the pillow and I sank into the abyss. My wife laughed hysterically as both sides of the pillow covered the sides of my face turning me into the headless horseman. I corrected this by putting a small firm pillow in the middle. Is this an optimal solution? No. But since I've purchased this pillow I've been sleeping much better. The giant king size is extremely comforting. Just very disappointed at the lack of firmness and the fact I need another pillow to use hand in hand with this one.",neutral

RX16ZJ40JMEJ5," Good support, cheap feel",92z07,3,19-Jun-21,"These are designed well for the money. The gusset really works, the height is perfect for side sleepers, and the support is med-firm. I dont know how people are saying these are soft. Mine definitely isn't. It compares to an old firm pillow I bought at a store. Maybe compared to a memory foam pillow it feels soft, but my head is kept well elevated. The issues I found with this pillow are that it's kind or springy or bouncy, and that it makes a slight plastic crinkly noise when you move around. So probably a case of you get what you pay for. You want gussets and nice firm support for 10 a pillow? Well. Tradeoffs have been made.",neutral

They're the perfect mix of soft and firm, providing that ""sink in and snuggle"" feeling while offering great support. My boyfriend is a two-pillow sleeper, but gave up on using a second pillow with these after about a week, because it was no longer needed; the new pillows provided such great support that adding the second pillow actually brought his head up too high, making the angle uncomfortable.

I ordered the king size, and they are the perfect size. I definitely recommend these pillows!",positive
RWSZA4OMSBM1O, Terrible Pillows,Lpoly,1,21-Feb-21,"I’m still trying to figure out why these pillows have great reviews. They are lumpy with foam pieces, so much so you can see the lumps over the pillow case. They bunch up on a side of the case and need to be fluffed frequently. They are terrible. I kept them because of covid and thought it unfair to return after using them and trying to get used to them. They are the third row of decorative pillows purposely hidden. They’ll be in the closet soon enough.",negative

R3CQU4BH5C4USY, Best set of Pillows for the Money on Amazon,John Carlos,5,23-Oct-20,"My mother always gave me great life advice. One of those life tips was to get new pillows at least every year. And if you think about it, that's good advice. In a year your pillows get over 2,000 hours of wear-and-tear if you sleep 6 hours a night, almost 3,000 if you sleep for 8 hours nightly. Side note: Mom also wisely advised to throw your pillows in the dryer on high for about 15 minutes every time you wash your sheets. It fluffs them back up and also disinfects.

On to the review. When they arrive vacuumed backed I opened the plastic and tossed them in the dryer for 15 minutes and poof - a nice and solid fluffed pillow. They fill out the pillowcase perfectly and the strip on the side of the pillow shows through the case just enough to give it a hotel quality look.

After test driving them for a couple of weeks (a good 80 hours) I give them a solid recommendation. I am a side and stomach sleeper and tend to hug the whole of the pillow and these suites me perfectly. My girlfriend sleeps on her back and hates a pillow that raiser her neck too much. She feels these give just enough.

Considering these pillows cost $15 each when I ordered them (two Kings for $28.99) they seem like a bargain.

So at the end of the day, I think these will hold up just fine for the year I'm looking to get out of them. And if in another month, they are still holding their original shape (which we all know will degrade as time passes), I think I will reorder another pair and set them aside for next year when I change out pillows again.",positive

These pillows are flat as a pancake. No support. Have to fold them at least in half to get something out of them. Literally, my head touches all the way down to my bed through 2 of them! They're absolutely useless. I bought 2 other pillow from the store to replace these right away.",negative

R2G4M8FWKNAR7P, Try them,B. Johnson,5,30-Oct-20,"Pillow preference varies by individual, but these pillows worked for me.

I had constant should/neck pain over several months that started with one bad night's sleep. I tried various pillows and sleeping positions to fix the problem. In the end the fix was pretty simple: I have broad shoulders and needed pillows that supported my neck better when I sleep on my side. Duh!

Quality of these pillows is high and I personally prefer down alternative to down, gel or foam.

What I did was order three sets of pillows (including this set) and then tried each of them--and a combination of them. The rejects are now our guest pillows.

Good luck. The perfect pillow for you is out there.",positive

Standard pillows = 20"" x 26"", while Queen = 20"" x 30"", however these so-called 'Queen' pillows are 18"" x 26""...the length of a standard pillow :(

Fortunately, the King sized ones are indeed King sized - 18"" x 36"".

They were flat as flat could be at first, but the directions say to shake them and fluff them for about 5 minutes to re-fluff and they puffed right up. They are pretty darn comfy. I like a pillow I can bend and fold to tuck under my head/neck and these are fluffy enough to stay full and return to their shape, but not too full that I can't mush them about. I gave 4 stars because I have had better pillows, but for the price point, these are amazing. Even bought a set for my in-laws to add to their bed pillows.",positive
R9F0PKUJG73FS, My take on these pillows.,Amazon Customer,4,15-May-20,"My pillows came in a vacuum sealed bags that were folder and tied with a ribbon and then in one of those plastic zipper bags like shown in the picture. Upon unzipping, seeing that ribbon honestly made he feel nice, I know they’re just pillows but the presentation and the way it was packed was really nice. Taking them out of the vacuum sealed bags the flipped up pretty nice, I looked the fluff up by pulling it and then putting them in the dryer. They were pretty fluffy when I took them out, however when I did initially fluff them I knew already they were going to be very very soft, so those who prefer their pillows on the firm side, probably won’t like these pillows that much. I do tend to like my pillows on the firm side, but I think they’ll be comfortable enough. The pricing isn’t that bad either, they’re pretty well made and also they appear to be a little longer than pillows I’ve tried before with is nice, so if you’re 5’ like me this is an added plus, it can be a body pillow. Overall, I’m pretty satisfied with my purchase, I can see myself repurchasing in the future. Thanks all, thank you. I hope the review helps you decide.",positive

They came as flat as the pictures show in other reviews due to the vacuum seal. One you open it they seem to inflat to a large fluffy pillow & mine have stayed that way. I did not put them in the dryer for prep or to fluff them up like some of the other reviewers. Mine have worked perfectly well as they came. They are large & rounded enough that when you put your arm over one in a hug position it is comfortable and feels great. It supports your head without feeling like you are sinking to the mattress layer & it is not so firm that I would consider it a firm or hard pillow. I consider it a soft, fluffy pillow with good supportive filling. It is great for sleeping on your back or side. Comfortable for head, legs/knees and arms.",positive

The packaging was great and when I opened the pillows I tried fluffing them up to just what I would like. These were great and seemed to be perfect, but over a short period of time they fully fluffed out and are the biggest and firmest pillows we have had. They get so big that we can't even use them. I will say they must be good quality in some way, because they aren't collapsing at all LOL I guess everyone has their likes and preferences, but I think I'm going to have to open these and remove filling if I want to use them at all.

Two for each of us. I am a pillow lover but I can honestly say I only needed one. These stay plump and firm. Best pillows I have had in a long time. Very comfortable. They stay cool which is a plus since I'm a hot sleeper. Supports my head and neck. I would definitely buy again but I have a feeling I probably won't need to for a long time.,positive
R170DYMQGAL0AE, Best buy in a Pillow set !!,MRH,5,12-Jan-19,"When the pillows arrive they are flat as a pancake due to being vacuumed into air tight plastic wrap. Upon opening the pillows begin expanding. I waited about 5 minutes and began swapping them in and out of the dryer for roughly 15 minutes. Long enough for each one to expand as large as it should be. Put a queen size pillow case on them, and that night used them. Incredibly soft, and still just firm enough that you didn't sink into the pillow. I've bought about every kind of pillow sold now. Literally. For $21.00, this is a great value. I can't speak to longevity at this point. But right now I'm very pleased with the outcome of this purchase. Lastly, for those two pillow sleepers like myself. These pillows are perfect for that. I uses a heavy side sleeper pillow, and then a thinner pillow on top. Trouble is, or rather was, the thinner pillows were always cheap ones and uncomfortable. This pillow solved that problem. Very well. Also, these pillows are far superior to anything found at Wal-Mart. Which to find anything there worth owing, (Beauty Rest) is twice this price and half as comfortable.",positive

I've tried cheap ones from Target and even went up to $100 pillow from bed bath & beyond but none of them gave me the support I needed without being too bulky. I figured I'd try these because they looked perfect in the picture as far as puffiness went, and figured I couldn't go wrong for the price. I I figured I'd just put them in the spare bedroom if they didn't work out, but lo and behold these are the ones. Don't let the cheap price fool you.

Cons: Very thin material and the sewing lines aren't perfect. Two weeks of use in and I started finding clumps of cotton in the bed. I investigated and the grey strip in my pillow has failed in a 3-4 inch strip on both sides of the strip and cotton is coming out. Worst of all my sewing skills are trash and I can't fix it.

I usually sleep on my back or side, it's fluffy enough to support either without being too thick.

My one complaint so far is that it sheds, badly. I'm not even sure how that's happening, but every time I change my pillow case (once a week) there's fluff all over the place.",positive

Now if you use an A/C or keep your room at a steady low heat and low humidity level, then these might just be the pillow for you as they will keep you warm much like a down comforter. Otherwise the only reason I could honestly suggest these is if you have a low body temperature, or really need that support for your neck.

Because let me tell you, if your in the market fore support, then look no further. Aside from the more expensive memory foam pillows, these are the most supportive and snug pillows you'll find at cost.

I've had them these for a couple months and they haven't gone flat. Still fluffy I would recommend these. Unless you are a pillow Nazi then don't buy online! You Pillow Nazi's need to actually go to the store so you can feel and squish your pillows to see if they are acceptable enough for you. I had one crappy pillow growing up. Any and all pillows are amazing to me!! I would buy these again if I need new pillows.

It gets 3 stars because honestly the pillows are wonderful! They fluff up in the dryer just fine like every says (I did 30 mins). They are firm yet sinkable. One pillow under the head is just fine. It's a little too fluffy/firm for between the legs but maybe if I didn't fluff it so much it would be good height, who knows? Still using the second and hoping I don't have to wash it. Also, it could very have been that my cheap apt washer is the reason. The material itself feels sturdy, I was surprised it ripped open.",positive

My experience with these pillows was this - opened one up from the vacuum sealed pouch, fluffed it up a bit by hand. It was still pretty floppy so fluffed it in the dryer with no heat. Still floppy. Layed down on it, my head was immediately through the pillow to the bed. No support whatsoever, really cheap filling that moves and lumps all over the place even immediately after fluffing.

When they arrived the box was intact with no damage. When I open them up it smelled like mold, but I didn’t think anything of it I figured that was maybe just the smell of the box. The plastic wrap on the pillows was in tact and sealed, and when I pulled the pillows out they were covered in mold. They smelled horrible and I couldn’t believe that Someone actually pulled and package these for delivery. You couldn’t miss the mold on the pillows. I was so unhappy with this purchase especially given that I had paid like $50 for two sets.

They’re like a feather pillow. We thought they would expand and become more like the previous ones but they didn’t. We’ve been working with these new pillows trying to see if there was something we needed to do, but they are still flimsy, no support and cheaply made. Seams are unraveling.

Decided to try buying online vs a store as a last resort and I’m glad I did. Bought a set of standard sized first for my queen bed, and loved them. They have stayed soft yet supportive/firm even through long nights of being sandwiched under my lower back. When I switched to a king sized I ordered these in the larger size.

It’s not that this pillow was bad, it just was not what I would describe as “soft, fluffy, or Moldable.” Nor would I say it was good for a side sleeper. It’s so high and stuff, you would wake up with the worst neck ache in the world due to sleeping on your side half-way up up. I didn’t have any issues with the pillow “fluffing up” when I opened it, but it was just way too firm and stiff for me, causing me to be far more elevated in bed.

The best pillow I bought was a RLP (ralph lauren polo) at Kohls, because I waited too long in line, despite the sticker price shock $40/single, to leave without a decent supporting sidesleeper (and back sleeper due to cats) pillow.

RG0JV81RQ7O2M, JUST BUY THEM!,SJ,5,3-Oct-21,"I LOVE THIS PILLOW!

By no means am I qualified to rate pillows on their effectiveness. Honestly, I’ve had pillows that were pretty flat & they were fine to me. However, I decided to get some new ones & I ended up going with this brand. I have their Duvet & I really like it.

Anyway, back to the pillows. First, I love how affordable they are. Second, how comfortable & fluffy they are. Not too soft or hard. I’m a stomach/side sleeper & they are perfect.

When they first arrive, they’re vacuum-sealed, so it’s extremely flat. But once taken out, they fluff up immediately. Also, I popped them in the dryer for about 5 minutes which helped even more.

Pictures:
*The pillows w/ the grey trim were taken out of the packaging to fluff up for about 30 mins. & popped in the dryer for about 5 mins.*

The pillows w/ the blue trim: I’ve had them since Jan. of this year & they still work/look good. !

They come vacuum sealed in box that looks impossible to contain 2 pillows lol. Once opened they fluff up nicely and don't lose their shape once you sleep on them.

When I get up the pillow hasn’t flattened; which provides great neck support like nothing I have ever received from any prior pillows. This is one that I’d want to bring with while traveling or needing to be admitted into a hospital. Very bad back and need to get a couple vertebrae fused (ongoing back problems for 5+ years.)

I will say, that after I opened them they had a very distinct smell that I would call ""citrusy."" I had a few other people smell them and they said the same thing. Fortunately, the scent disappeared a few days after being out of the packaging.",positive
R1JKNZAB8DE2IF, No support for side sleepers,Courtney & Tony (Best husband☺️),3,12-Oct-20,These are the types of pillows that look fluffy but once you lay on them all the air goes out of them and you have no cushion. They might be ok for a back sleeper but if you're a side sleeper this will make your neck crane over like you're not even sleeping with a pillow. Very uncomfy other than for the use of using is as a prop between you and the headboard/wall. Depending on the bed you have. Will be using a decorative pillows in the future. They're okay for if you like a pillow between you legs when you sleep though.,neutral

Yeah, they're big and fluffy but I need a firm pillow. These pillows would work inside a pillow sham but I can buy cheaper pillows for that. Thankfully I kept the box and plastic bag that they came in and I shall return them. I've learned my lesson, I shall be going to an actual store and feel the pillows for excessive fluffiness or firmness, you can't do this when buying pillows online.",negative

However husband sleeps on his back and he loves them, and our daughter sleeps on her side, she loves them too!

R11QUXGRT22CTG, Great for side sleepers,Brian,5,27-Feb-21,Bought 2 of these so far and will buy more! Very comfortable for side sleepers. Shipping and packaging great and arrived in a timely fashion as promised- actually I believe a day early. Good quality and do. not totally flatten down and stay there. Easy to plump back up by shaking the pillow out. Compressed just enough over time to be totally comfortable. Takes a few days to adjust to your head pressure but still comfortable.,positive
R3SQHMCX9B5JPR, Avoid this pillow!,Long time Amazon Customer,1,20-Nov-19,These pilllows are terrible! It is like sleeping on the cheapest junk pillow you would find at a garage sale. I didn't return them because I struggled with how to repackage them! They were not worth the effort and cost of returning! I have not one single positive thing to comment. Filling is too soft and feels like chunks of foam. They offer zero neck support. Bad for my back! No matter what position I tried they were uncomfortable! My old pillow that I had planned to throw away is 100% better then this terrible product!,negative
R38FWP3DRFN3SD, Great Pillows for a great price.,JOSEPH,5,25-Feb-19,"i have used these pillows for about 2 weeks now. I am vrey happy with the purchase. They fluffed up very easily and have kept there shape so far. They have plenty of filling and are not flat pancake pillows. they have good support and conform nicely. The quality is nice. there were no loose threades or holes, the gusset allows nice air flow, so pillows fluff up nicely. comes with instructions for recommended fluffing, which I thought was funny. I am happy with my pillows and would recommend these pillows to people who like a fuller pillow with a little more support. if you like the flatter pillows these are not for you.",positive

I washed them in cold water and dried them on low heat for about 45 mins and they went right back to their original shape. I bought these for my mom a couple of months ago and she begged me to buy some for myself because I was waking up with an aching shoulder from sleeping on my right side. She said it helped her sleep better so I’ll see how it does for me tonight.,positive

It wasn't a stench, but just enough to turn my stomach. You know, hotel pillow smell. So I put them in the dryer with dryer balls and a fabric softener for half an hour and what emerged was one of the fluffiest, most decadent pillows I have ever owned! I usually sleep on a gel and latex pillow, but wanted a couple to fill out my duvet shams. Now I am rethinking the decorative nature of my purchase and am going to sleep on them. I will update if they don't hold up, but for now, I am pretty pleased.",positive

R3IP8AVY2EPZ56, SOOOO SOFT. Keep fluffed.,Sam&Bryan,5,6-Dec-19,My fiancé bought these for us and I LOVE these pillows. I sleep on my back and my fiancé sleeps on his stomach and side and back lol he did not like it. He likes it for when the bed is made and it looks nice but he doesn’t use it I kind of just adopted his too. I sleep with one under my head and one along my side or under my feet or kind of like a body pillow? Just make sure when you make your bed in the morning to fluff them back up and to not put any other pillows on top. They’ll refluff but it takes forever so just keeping them fluffed and on top is a good idea.,positive

R1LJR41UPXFK37, Mid range Firm (medium-firm) Best Pillows I've ever bought. PERIODT!!!!,James B.,5,8-Feb-20,"And I know the word ""period"" does not have a ""t"" in it so don't judge the review by this intentional inclusion of the letter ""t"" at the end of the word, period. Now on to the review. Best nights sleep I've had in months. These pillows are perfect. I read other reviews and wasn't sure what to expect. But let me tell you as someone who is picky. These pillows fall right at the medium-firm range. In simple terms, lets establish that there are three categories of firm (including soft-firm, medium-firm, and firm). These pillows fall perfectly in the middle at medium-firm. I am writing this review at 5 AM in the morning and as soon as I finish this review, I am ordering more of these pillows. This is money well spent and if they raised the price another $5 to $7, I would definitely buy them again without hesitation. If I had an Amazon store credit card, I'd buy 3 more sets total for me and 2 sets for my 2 grandkids. One more thing....don't get upset thinking the driver forgot to bring your pillows when you open the box like I did. The pillows are shrink wrapped and expand when taken out of the plastic.

I like pillows thats a little more firm. I just got these today and I'm going to give them away because I ordered another set that I prefer better!

R37LIORF6WLQ6B, Manufacturing/Quality Control Issues,loon,2,18-Apr-21,"I have bought these twice previously over the last few years and I liked them a lot. The design is perfect for how I sleep.

My most recent (third) purchase arrived with filling spilling out and caught up in the seams, which were frayed or otherwise messed up in multiple places as it looks like the filling was coming out during the sewing process and the filling got in the way. The bag had filling in it as well due to this.

I ordered a replacement pair and they arrived promptly with the same issue. I simply returned the second pair and will look for another brand from now on.

One pair having this issue wouldn't have been a problem, but when the replacement shows up with the same issue it suggests a problem with the manufacturing or quality control process.",negative

R1YM9H1QO21LCX, Horrible pillows,Erin Fusco,1,17-Jul-20,Horrible pillows. I opened one and could instantly tell they wouldn’t be comfortable. When you lay your head down it hits the mattress. There’s nothing to these pillows to support your head at all. What’s worse is I’m stuck with them. They come vacuum sealed in a tiny box. As soon as you pull them out they start “inflating”. I couldn’t get half of one back in the box. I didn’t have any higher boxes to return them in. When requested to return I was only given the labels to send back and would have needed to buy a box to stuff them into. It wasn’t worth the cost of the box vs what I spent on them. Don’t waste your money.,negative

RO3IVP8X9WS99, Too hard!,Susan Sterling,1,1-Nov-19,These pillows are not 'medium' firm... they come compressed and you have to unseal them and let them sit for a day or two to fully expand.

Follow the instructions for fluffing (something about putting them in the sun IIRC) and they fluff up great. I would say these were 10/10 pillows for the entire first year, and likely went south shortly after that, and I've stretched them to being flat and dull at this point exactly two years later and am ordering another set. I should have done this six months ago tho.

So expect a happy lifespan of 12-18 months.",positive

However, if you are looking for any amount of firmness, these are definitely not for you.

It took me maybe a couple minutes per pillow to fluff when I got them and there was no smell at all. I used them the night they were delivered and had a fantastic sleep.",positive

Would anyone be happy with a piano that was compressed into a toybox size for shipping ??? NO they would not, and this is a fair comparison to the steamroller looking pillow i recieved. Will not fluff up, and looks and feels like the worn flat pillows i am trying to replace. Nowhere did it say you will recieve flattened pillows, it says fluffy stay supportive like a cloud pillows. You ruined them by compression. I will shop fluffy pillows at walmart. This was the biggest disappointment EVER, no one should have to revive steamrolled pillows by shaking like a monkey and putting in a dryer. You should ship in a box that allows full size. My neck needed support and these FAILED. I might as well shake and fluff my old pillows and put in the dryer, they would be fluffier that these compressed dismal disappointments.",negative
R3UQG7SENL4F35, Lumpy & no support,Sarah Davis,1,11-Oct-19,They come vacuum sealed and have to be fluffed. We put them in the dryer with tennis balls for 20 minutes as the instructions say. They come out lumpy. When you lay on them it's basically like not having a pillow at all as you sink to the bottom. I suppose these will be used for the decorative shams but I would have been happier to buy dollar store pillows for that!,negative

These are great if you love extremely soft pillows that have no support whatsoever. I, on the other hand, am used to memory foam pillows that offer so much support. I wanted just a little bit of that firmness and support from these pillows, but I got none. They’re basically a cloud of feathers and hold no shape.",neutral
R2LZ29JZQQLZJ9, Terribly thin,RobinW,1,17-Jul-20,These are super thin with no support at all. The pillows flop over the second you lift them up because there's not enough filling.

You can see in the one photo I'm just pinching between two fingers and I can feel my other finger right through the maybe 1 inch of filling that's there. I'm very disappointed.,negative
RMPWB7JVO78MF, Has Comfort of a Wet Sponge,Carly Boler,1,5-Apr-20,"Very disappointed. I very particular about my pillows and hoped that they would be everything that the reviews said.

I recommend a touch of copper pillows.",negative

From the time I took them out of the package and let them expand and put my head on them I knew I had finally found my perfect sleeper. I am a side sleeper. Every morning I make the bed, I fluff each pillow and by the time I go to bed that night, they have fluffed out where you would never know someone had slept on it.

Do they function as pillows? Sure.
Are they worth 12.50 each? No.

If you need cheap pillows you can do way better than this. Not recommended at all",negative

I’m using them when I sit up in bed and watch movies or just want to lay elevated a little. But not very comfortable to sleep on. I followed the instructions and fluffed them A LOT when I took them out of the vacuum sealed bags they came in. Maybe next time I won’t fluff so much.",positive
RJ0O7BYNN3BDN, Pillows,motorhead,2,19-Oct-18,The pillows arrived well packed and completely flat. each pillow was in a plastic bag and had been vacuum sealed to make them as small as possible. Even after fluffing these pillows up they are thinner than what I was expecting. I will be taking some of the stuffing out of one of the pillows and adding it to the other pillow to make it thicker. I like to sleep on my side and need a pillow that is thicker. I will be buying my pillows from the store so I can see and feel them before buying.,negative
R2TMSM36JI5A26, Fluffy finally,Mallory Parmer,5,12-May-20,Upon taking these out of the package I was a little worried because they didn’t fluff up as much as I was anticipating. I then remembered reading some reviews before purchasing about putting them in the dryer for some time to allow them to fluff. They also included their own instructions to do so that I just so happened to ignore! Lol I did that and boy was I pleased! They fluffed right up and I sleep so well on them. I am a notorious pillow folder because I can never get the desired high but not with these pillows!,positive

These are so thick, you might as well just pad your headboard and jam your head against it. Because your head isn't resting on the top of a raised level surface, but instead just awkwardly propped up on a steep slope, forcing your spine to bear the weight of your head instead of the pillow.

RNPWC28FJJCOE, 6 Months Later,Kristy Watkins,5,12-Jan-20,I have had these for about 6 months maybe a little longer still holding up and still very comfortable. I don’t think mine have went down in fluffiness. For me it’s the right amount of fluff and just firm enough. I actually wanted some more new ones decided to go with some that were a little more expensive and said they were firm but they are like the ones you can get at the dollar store so I would definitely buy these again.,positive

We took them out of the shipping packaging, went through the fluffing process then tried laying on them. Our heads sunk down into the pillow and my husband who has a larger, heavier head, said the pillow wrapped around his face like he was buried in it. There is no way the pillows are ""medium-firm"".

R3OS2WHA39OHZB, Really Nice Pillows,Melinda F.,5,3-Nov-19,"These pillows are really nice for the price. They arrived vacuum sealed so they needed to be fluffed quite a bit. I chose the ""beat the pulp out of them"" method. It worked great. I got in a workout, got rid of some excess aggression, and had really nicely fluffed pillows when it was all over. I have slept on my pillow for a few days now and have no complaints. They have not flattened out at all but if they do, I'll just slap them around a bit.",positive

They arrived vacuum-packed and so I left them for a few days to puff up. I added some pillow covers I had at the house, and then took them for a test drive! I've been sleeping on one of them for several months now, and the pillow is comfortable, not too hot, and does support my neck. I might wish it were a touch firmer, but given how hard it is to find a firm pillow at the right thickness, I'm happy with this for now!",positive
R2N39VNSWGVFE3, Poorly made,howard,2,16-Feb-21,The pillows arrived but were poorly made. The seem wasn’t finished properly and as a result the stuffing was exposed.

Haven’t slept on these pillows yet and hopefully they are comfortable.,negative
RQBNLCT5T389B, Not a good pillow. Too soft,JD,2,6-Jun-21,In all honesty these pillows are not great. They are extremely soft. There is zero support. You will sink through them. I had to ball into a tiny ball just to have support. At this point we've decided to give them to the dogs to lay their heads on. They are not good pillows.,negative

So far they expanded back to regular size and should hold. I found they sink as you lay on them.",neutral
R2JV8VOGMCSJ95, Not firm at all,Allison,1,15-Sep-20,I trusted other reviews that this pillow is accurate to its description and is semi-firm. Do not make the same mistake I did.

R2U453M87I5DC6, Worth it!!,Holly Thomas,5,3-Aug-20,"I’ll be honest. After pulling these bad boys out of the packing and shaking them out for a few minutes I was prepared to write a less than stellar review. I was so defeated, but I took a step back and threw both pillows in the dryer with a couple tennis balls. Twenty minutes is all it took for these pillows to puff up and fully reach their potential!

These pillows come vacuum packed, which is OK, but opening them up and giving them a fluff and I was very disappointed. The fill material inside is twisted and balled up and you can feel places with large lumps or no fill at all. Honestly, I haven't even slept on them yet and they feel like the worn out pillows I'm replacing. There is no way these pillows ever sold for $50. Get in the car, go to Target, and buy a $10 pillow that feels 3x better than these. These are not premium pillows.",negative

I keep 4 pillows on the bed and ordered 2 different pillows from Target at the same time that were similarly priced and they are as flat as pancakes now...My husband gets those 2 every night...lol.

This is not a super firm pillow, so don’t buy for firmness. If you like a thick, medium-softness pillow and you’re a side sleeper, these are a great choice.",positive

If you're a fan of super soft fluffy pillows you can bend and maneauver however you move around at night, this will do the trick. If you're looking for neck support, without other pillows as your base, this will not do the trick. All depends on what you need.

RQSG44GSAS31Z, Surprisingly good and well worth the money,Peter W.,5,5-Feb-19,"I've had these about 3 weeks and I really like them. I was skeptical due to low cost and my never ending pillow hunt but these have outperformed pillows I paid 3X or more for. For me it's the right balance of soft and firm. The footprint isn't too tall and it's held up to 3 weeks of daily use. I did the dryer fluff thing (twice) because I was concerned it wasn't tall enough.

I'm not sure how long they'll hold up but, at this price, I'd be happy with anything greater than 6 months.

RFM7E9FA4V4K5, Fluffy and comfy,Donna,5,7-Mar-21,Very comfortable! I love them...so much so I bought two more sets. Compared to local retail stores these are much better....yes they are flat when you first receive them but within an hour they are super fluffy with some firmness to them. Great value for the price!!!,positive
R3QQSN7VJR4JKT, NOT WORTH THE HYPE,MamaBear,2,27-Feb-20,I purchased these in December of 2019. After owning these $30 king pillows for 2 months I would argue they are not worth the money. After a couple of weeks they have become extremely flat and are not of a medium firmness. Despite fluffing these as recommended. If I had a guest room I’d put them in there. Because I would not want anyone to get too comfortable and stay long 😂,negative
R2KVFTAQN4NSV0, A steal at this price,Jameel,5,25-May-19,"So, a few people mentioned not receiving instructions at all. I got absolutely nothign with my pillows except the packaging they came in. I did what others suggested, except I put them both in the dryer at the same time, and they came out wonderfully. I've never owned a ""good"" pillow so all I have to compare it to is the stuff I've used from Kohls or a Bamboo pillow, but these are soft and seem to maintain shape. No neck or other muscle pain yet.",positive
R143YWPF5VHIQY, Horrible.,S. Baumann,1,21-Aug-19,"Worst pillows I have ever seen or felt. They go flat as soon as you lay on them. No support. Would not reccomend these at all.

R2VNRXIFDJASHU, Super Comfortable!!,Tamia,5,19-Dec-20,I was very excited to receive these pillows. I’ve been waking up sore and getting migraines. I didn’t understand why because I had expensive memory foam pillows to help me sleep. As soon as I started fluffing these pillows up (they get VERY fluffy) I could tell I was going to be comfortable. As soon as I handed my boyfriend one to lay down on he was smiling. He even took my pillow to cuddle for a short while. These pillows are 110% worth it.,positive
RUDGLHM7PZZ5F, Very comfortable,rachel wellborn,5,22-Apr-21,"Pillows are a hard thing to review, as everyone's comfort preference is different. However I was very satisfied with these, especially for the price. They fluffed up almost immediately. I prefer super soft pillows, and these are a bit... sturdy, with great support and a good size. I will def be buying more for my boy's room.",positive
R2IECNKDL3XLVK," Not for Side Sleepers, VERY unsupportive",Angela,2,5-May-20,"Very nice packaging. However, these pillows are VERY flat, with uneven fill - even after fluffing. They are NOT what you’re looking for if you want any kind of support for side sleeping. I don’t know how I missed reading recent reviews, but if you read recent reviews you will also wonder how these come up as pillows you should get for side sleeping.",negative
R31GSGRPZPOIG5, Could replace all the sadness on your bed,Desiree Weber,4,31-Jul-20,"I love having an ocean of pillows to make me feel comfy, but with this one I have cut back on over half my pillow consumption. Like a decent person walking in your life, you feel the need to get rid of lumpy or odd pillows. This doesn't cure depression but makes sleeping so I want to get out bed much easier. I never want to leave my bed and naps are key to recharging on my time at home. Overall pretty good for quality, would use for road trips, if we could actually leave the house safely. Kicks butt over the hotel pillows, which, ewwwwwww.",positive
RIE8FWH34T594, Firm But Not Supportive,shoeloverforreal,3,7-May-21,I dont like these to sleep in because they are so firm and hard. But I use then to decorate my bed. So I kept them for that reason.

R3VM91JMVGOX4U, Not worth it,Quimesha,2,25-Jul-21,"These pillows only lasted about 2 months. They don’t hold up and offer no neck support for side sleepers. They quickly lost their fluff and basically because deflated dream holders after about two months.

RNX4QC6R62B6T, Eh,Sladernom,2,11-Jul-21,"Pillows came out with excess fluff/stuffing covering them, and the seams of the pillows have multiple spots where the stitching is loose (though not cut/disconnected). They're also a little bit crinkly around the sides where the blue strip is.
Otherwise, they are very soft once they fluff up again from being vacuum-packed, so they're nice to lounge with, though because they're so soft they don't really offer much head support.
Gotten better rest from random pillows I've gotten from walmart for half the price, so I can't really recommend these.",negative
R3DRA56XK10U2B, cheap and bad quality,KLuv,2,23-Jul-20,I ordered these pillows because they seemed good for the price. I got a 2 set of king size and 2- 2 sets of queen size. They couldn't even be bothered to properly stitch the pillows.,negative
RABVOR0TT3EWG, Can’t believe I didn’t buy sooner.,Faith1212,5,9-Feb-21,Must buy! I was waking up 3-5 times each night. I thought it was my bladder but it was my pillow. The first two nights with this pillow and I only wake up once! I feel well rested. It’s soft yet medium firmness to support your neck and head. Like the material compresses as your head weight lays immediately. So it’s the right softness yet medium firmness to keep supporting all night long. Don’t hesitate replacing your pillows! Great price and great product. If you like really firm then choose something else.,positive
R1GQCDGDAZ8CJ5, Lumpy and Terrible,Andrea Bonhiver,1,31-Aug-20,"I followed instructions exactly. I let them air out for 24 hours and they still hadn't fluffed up very much. So I put them in the dryer, as the packaging insert suggested. This didn't fluff them up, but instead made the filling very lumpy. We tried shaking them out before bed to fluff them up more and nothing worked. They didn't support our heads in the least. The filling split up and our heads were basically on the mattress. Would not recommend.",negative
R1OAUXE20WHRGL, amazed,Yoyo329,5,15-Sep-21,"I received these around 5 pm and they come in a small box. I was so worried that even if they fluffed up they wouldn't hold the firmness, I was wrong. I used the pillows the same night and boy were they nice and firm. I am very surprised.",positive

RBV8USHVJ7KDF, Noooooooo,JC,1,13-Aug-21,"I have absolutely no idea why this pillow has such high ratings. There is no support, no comfort, there really is not one nice thing I have to say about it. I have to sleep on my side with my head at the edge of the pillow otherwise I feel like I am being suffocated with it. As soon as you lay your head down the pillow surrounds your face/head. I gave it a few nights to make sure it wasn't just me and its not....its the pillow. So, into guest pillow storage they go.",negative
R17V719O00H0S2, So comfortable,Jennifer,5,15-Aug-20,I was amazed at how comfortable these pillows are.

R2CZPILBVEHV04, Give them a chance!,Haley C.,5,1-Mar-21,"At first I was concerned, these came completely flat in plastic packaging.

R2Y4O0A0PR465U, Good pillow but not squishable,J Riley,4,20-Oct-20,These came vacuum packed and were easy to fluff up. I honestly thought they would be more squishable and maintain a shape. They are firmer than I expected. These are not a bad pillow at all just not what I thought they would be. Gave them to my son who likes firmer pillows and he thought they were fine.,positive
R3UT1ESBF9OLN0, Extremely soft not worth $10 each,W.Rivas,2,12-Feb-19,Im tired of buying the $3 pillows at Walmart so i decided to get this ones. Since it have so many great reviews why not? The pictures where it shows how big they get after opening the package is true. But when you put your head on it. The pillow is so soft that your head go down half way. They arent firm or close to firm. They are soooooo soft it feels like you have no pillow. You need to use two to feel the difference. Not good if you have neck problems.,negative
R1KR17RIRWNBB1, Such a flat pillow.....,Mommayama,1,1-Apr-20,"I ordered 2 of these and they are nothing like what's described. The pictures look fluffy and supportive.

R28KGLO3XMKFS9, Great Pillow for decoration???,A.Bradshaw,3,29-Oct-20,These pillows are great quality but for my preference are way to full.

I got the king sized pillows which were already pushing my king-sized pillow cases. Like, just a little more than you’d like where they sort of stick out. Once I opened them up they filled up really quickly. Honestly, they could have used LESS filling. After a bit, they were lumpy and firm. Not a great combo.

So, huge, lumpy, poor quality filling, too firm, but also sort of spongy in some way? 2 stars is probably generous since I’ll only use them as back up - back ups.",negative

Flash forward just two months: the pillows in the shams have held up fine, but the ones I slept on have gone completely flat and lumpy, and no amount of re-fluffing is bringing these back to the state they were in after removing them from their vacuum packs.

I've also always preferred a bit of elevation to my sleep so if you're like me, just know that stacking these pillows works well and doesn't feel clunky like some others. Also, being machine washable is a big plus.

Basically, the only gripe I have is that it doesn't come with any pillow cases. But I didn't reflect that in the rating because it's not what I paid for. I just wanted good pillows. Which I now have.

First let me start off by saying, very skeptical to buy pillows online without seeing them in person. And reading reviews you take with a grain of salt because everyone has different issues.
They arrived Air tight and vacum pack, that i looked and thought what the heck are these.
They arrived, i unpacked them, and thought what the heck are these. I did not think these pillows would fluff up at all. Lo and behold, we unpackaged the pillows one by one and when we unwrapped our first one, it started to fluff up already, i could not believe it, a couple of pats to the pillows and fluffing with the hands and viola, they were a nice size pillow, not to fluffy, not too firm. They seem just right, but you must try them first. So we did, now we both have problems husband and myself with neck and back issues.
The pillow is more of a soft pillow like laying your head on a cloud, but with support of the head and neck, which is what you want.
The pillows are soft and resilent so it seems for now, i just hope that they keep there shape, that is the tricky part.
For now we seem happy, because our heads and neck are supported and or heads do not sink into the pillow but are supported.
This is more of a soft pillow then a firm one, but not soft enough where it does not support your neck.
For now while still new, we are happy with the pillows, but only time will tell.
Our pillows came out perfectly fluffed up, no lumps no bumps, just a perfect looking pillow. And for the price you have nothing to lose. And they are a nice looking pillow with the gusset. While the pillow may help some of course it will not help everyone else, for everyone has different issues, but worth trying for the price, and for me and for now they work.",positive

R3VJYJVTMWT5CA," Big, Cushy Pillows Fluff Up When Plastic Is Removed",SeattleBookMama,5,13-Jul-17,"There's an old saying: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. These pillows are basically old-school pillows, apart from the fact that they don't puff up to their full size until you take them out of the wrapper (which makes for easier shipping and a less expensive product). I took off the plastic, left them out in the sun for a couple of hours, came back to get them, and they were fluffy, smooth, and fat. The slight factory odor was gone. Those that prefer a flatter pillow won't like these, but I like a big cushy pillow behind my back when I read sitting up and then under my knees while I sleep, and these are just dandy. I purchased these and also a fancy gel pillow because I was expecting much-loved guests soon and wanted to be sure I had at least a couple of good ones. The fancy one was a waste of time and money.

When I lift my head for even a small amount of time it puffs right back up. So, I do not use it for my head. I am using it to rest my arm (up against my chest) because I am a side sleeper. Since my arm is not heavy it works well. It just an expensive pillow for my arm.

My preference is a nearly-flat down pillow that will fluff a bit and then go flat in a day or two: these pillows are not like that; so if you like low-profile and soft pillows that flatten out easily, these are not the pillow for you.

They are a good value and a high-quality pillow, however, and most households should have a few of these - many family members and guests will like this pillow.

For the rest of us ... I am still searching for a down or down-alternative pillow that does not cost $50 to $70 each. Department store prices are insane on a down or down/feather or down-alternate pillow.",positive

I've used the pillows, or tried to, for a couple nights. To me they feel like having your head on a large sponge.

R2BRN9TDFGPE0," Firm, not too firm. Soft, not too soft. 10/10",Amazon Customer,5,10-Dec-17,"Just recently got ""Deployed"" to Kuwait. When I arrived here there was minimal bedding available on post and ZERO pillows available. I was extremely upset that there were no pillows here because I was using one of those stupid travel neck pillows from the airport to sleep on. So I went on Amazon and found this one that looked firm, but not firm, and soft, but not too soft. Honestly it's pretty damn comfy. It supports my head well after long days of agony and it really makes my twin mattress feel like home. Especially with a big fluffy comforter, you really can't go wrong. I'm using it in the middle east, but I would totally use one of these bad boys in the states. Maybe I'll buy some more for my house.",positive

R1PXP5B1XFGXLS, You get what you pay for,Rick,2,28-Apr-17,"I admit, I bought these on a sale and let the price override my common sense. Upon opening I noticed one of the pillows had some ""faded red"" staining on it...have no idea what that is. These pillows should definitely be rated soft. I'm a side sleeper and immediately discovered one pillow didn't offer enough support at all. So I layed one on top of the other. Well, my head was now supported high enough but because of their softness, the top one ended up wrapping around my face and I'm not a fan of smothering. Alas, I have moved them to the guest bedroom, thinking that these will at least prevent long visits.",negative

R12JNUNPFR3VZA, .......Two months later. Flat.,MatthewGB,1,24-Jul-17,"I started to feel about a week ago that these were flattening out, so I compared them to the set I bought for the spare room. I was right they're about 50% flatter than they started. Just to be clear I fluff these up when I make the bed and before I go to sleep. To me it feels like the fiber fill is separating into smaller groups of fiber.
This is so annoying because they started of great but didn't even hold up after two months.
Most of these reviews were probably written within a week of receiving them.
If I can offer manufacturers a tip it would be to add a zipper so we can add more fiber and not have to keep buying new pillows.",negative
R30WWZR8ASUL3U, Not Impressed. Pillow Appears to be Used and Repackaged,--wolverine--,1,15-Oct-17,"These Utopia Bedding gusseted pillows are substandard especially for the price. One pillow had a mark on it under the vacuum packaging leading me to believe that it is not new but a used (returned) and repacked pillow, which is so gross. I triple checked the mark to make sure it wasn't a loose thread and I am 100% certain that it is not a loose thread or a mark on the outside of the vaccum packaging. (Other reviewers stated seeing makeup and mold on the pillows, so it seems that this may not be isolated incident and that the seller is repackaging used returned items). Another issue is that there are many loose threads where the gusseted area meets the main pillow surface. This pillow seems like it will fall apart upon the first washing (which will happen before I use them since they are most likely used). This is NOT a quality item. Do not waste your money or time.

Two photos are attached, one of the close up mark on the pillow. The photo of the gusseted area shows the loose threads but they may be hard to make out unless you zoom in.",negative
